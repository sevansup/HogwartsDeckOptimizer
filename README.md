Optimizations for Hogwarts Legacy on the Steam Deck

Update on 3/8/2023: These .ini tweaks seem to still benefit the performance of the game even on the latest patch.

Place this Engine.ini file in:
/home/deck/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/990080/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Local/Hogwarts Legacy/Saved/Config/WindowsNoEditor/Engine.ini

You need to run the game at least once to generate this directory. To remove these tweaks, delete your Engine.ini file and the game will regenerate a fresh, default one.
